  <h1>
    JSON Web Service with Database Validation Example Model
  </h1>

  <p>
    This model illustrates the operation of a "User" JSON web service that
    stores, modifies and retrieves user name and gender to and from a
    database. Modeled here is the invocation of any sequence of HTTP GET,
    POST, or PUT method invocations for this "user" JSON web service. In
    the "PUT user" subdiagram it is exemplified how database validation
    can be modeled.
