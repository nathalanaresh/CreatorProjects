    Agile Bank Application

  <p>
    This example shows how Conformiq Creator models can be gradually
    refined from user stories into model from which test automation 
    can be generated, e.g., in an agile application development context. 
    The user story is based on Conformiq's 
    <a href="http://parabank.conformiq.com/parabank">Parabank
    sample web application</a>. Note that this example comes pre-configured 
    with the Excel scripting backend attached and allows immediate 
    rendering of  generated tests to Excel. Remember to close Microsoft 
    Excel after viewing generated Excel files - since MS Excel otherwise 
    prevents Conformiq to update the generated Excel files.

    Open from the <i>model</i> folder in the <i>Project Explorer</i> view
    the "Sprint 1" activity diagram. It shows the starting point for our
    model creation which is a model of the user story including logging
    into the banking application and user choosing between the three 
    different options:either open a new account, transfer money or 
    request a loan. Click on each business activity and 
    see in the <i>Properties</i> view of the <i>Conformiq Modeling</i>
    perspective that each business activity has more detailed <i>when</i> 
    and <i>then</i> business actions defined. The "Login" node also shows an
    example of modifying the default business activity parameter names 
    and adding a second parameter value set. Select the decision node 
    and review its specification in the <i>Properties</i> view to see how
    business activity parameters can be selected as a decision basis.
    Feel free to see how tests can be generated and rendered to Excel 
    - be default this activity diagram is selected as <i>main activity 
    diagram</i>. Notice that technically no structure diagram is needed 
    to generate tests from this pure business requirement model.

    The "Sprint 2" activity diagram shows the same functionality refined:
    Here, the user has captured application user interface information 
    in the "Bank Application User Interface" structure diagram, and then
    refined one of the flows, i.e., "Login" and "Open new account" business 
    activities by replacing them with activity nodes and drag & dropping
    actions from the <i>Action</i> view into the activity nodes. Also 
    specification of the decision basis has been updated to use the actual 
    form field and data that define what is "valid credentials". Finally, 
    observe that we have now added test data for credentials using a <i>value
    list </i>data object and injected it as a input constraint to the 
    fill form action. Again - feel free to select this activity diagram as 
    <i>main activity diagram</i> and see how tests can be generated and rendered 
    to Excel. Observe how the generated tests change - old tests become
    invalid since test steps for "Login" have changed, and we get more tests
    since we have specified more test data. Note that test data can also
    be linked from external spreadsheets - such as Excel (xls) files.
