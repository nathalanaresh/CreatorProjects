  <p>
    This example shows how to model with Conformiq Creator a system
    under test that is mainly tested via a user interface. The model
    describes a simple web shopping application where a user can add
    or remove a limited list of product items from a shopping cart and
    then checkout. It also includes two different variants of modeling
    a simple login process.

    The example illustrates the specification of graphical user
    interfaces available for testing in structure diagrams, as well as
    specification of graphical data flow, referencing of subdiagrams,
    use of domain specific actions such as click button, fill form,
    display screen, and display popup, and working with data tables in
    activity diagrams. All action keywords have been automatically
    generated from the structure diagrams.
